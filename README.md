## Overview

Our game, Dress To Impress, will be modeled after a dressing up simulator from Roblox. 
It will be a single player game, in which a character will follow a theme and use randomized 
clothes provided to dress up the character as best as possible. Each clothing item will have 
a point value tied to it based on how well it adheres to the theme. At the end of the timed 
dressing up section, the points will be tallied and be used to calculate a final rating for 
the outfit. 

## Instructions

Once the game is loaded, you can start dragging clothing items onto the avatar. The theme
is on the bottom of the screen.The buttons on the side of the menu will show different types of clothing. 
To remove items from the avatar, simply click and drag it back to the menu. The item will snap back into place even if 
you are not in the clothing type it originally came from. There are left/right arrows at the bottom
of the menu that acts as a scroll bar. *For Accesories, all the items are on the second tab*
If you wish to remove all the clothing, there is a reset button in the bottom right corner.
Once time runs out, the end screen will be displayed with the number of stars you recieved for 
your outfit.

*Some of the clothing fit weird on the avatar
